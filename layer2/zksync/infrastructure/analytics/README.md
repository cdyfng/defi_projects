# Analytics - CLI to provide finance consuming reports

## Configuration

The application tries to locate a configuration file in the current working directory - `./.analytics-config.json`.

The configuration file contains the default network and a list of all networks with their parameters. Each network has
the following arguments:

| Parameter                  | Description                                                    |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPERATOR_FEE_ETH_ADDRESS` | Ethereum Address to be used for zkSync account to collect fees |
| `REST_API_ADDR`            | Address where the zkSync REST API is located                   |

Also load environment variable `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` from .env file only once
