/// # Description
///
/// The essential part of this structure is an event loop (which is supposed to be run
/// in a separate thread), which obtains the operations to commit through the channel,
/// and then commits them to the Ethereum, ensuring that all the transactions are
/// successfully included in blocks and executed.
///
/// Also `ETHSender` preserves the order of operations: it guarantees that operations
/// are committed in FIFO order, meaning that until the older operation of certain type (e.g.
/// `commit`) will always be committed before the newer one.
///
/// However, multiple transaction can be "in flight" at the same time, see "Concurrent transaction
/// sending" section for details.
///
/// # Transaction sending policy
///
/// The goal is to handle stuck transactions.
///
/// When we try to commit operation to ETH, we select nonce, gas price, sign
/// transaction and watch for its confirmations.
///
/// If transaction is not confirmed for a while, we increase the gas price and do the same, but we
/// keep the list of all sent transaction hashes for one particular operations, since we can't be
/// sure which one will be committed; thus we have to track all of them.
///
/// Note: make sure to save signed tx to db before sending it to ETH, this way we can be sure
/// that state is always recoverable.
///
/// # Concurrent transaction sending
///
/// `ETHSender` supports sending multiple transaction to the Ethereum at the same time.
/// This can be configured by the constructor `max_txs_in_flight` parameter. The order of
/// transaction is still guaranteed to be preserved, since every sent tx has the assigned nonce
/// which makes it impossible to get sent transactions committed out of order.
///
/// Internally order of the transaction is determined by the underlying `TxQueue`, which provides
/// transactions to send for `ETHSender` according to the following priority:
///
/// 1. Verify operations (only if the corresponding commit operation was sent)
/// 2. Withdraw operations (only if both commit/verify for the same block operations were sent).
/// 3. Commit operations.
///
/// # Failure policy
///
/// By default, `ETHSender` expects no transactions to fail, and thus upon a failure it will
/// report the incident to the log and then panic to prevent continue working in a probably
/// erroneous conditions. Failure handling policy is determined by a corresponding callback,
/// which can be changed if needed.
